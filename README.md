# LED Matrix Testing

## Description
This is a basic implementation of an LED matrix using SFML for a GUI. The matrix is 10 x 10 in size and serves as a platform for creating and testing patterns for an LED matrix. This project is a preparatory step towards developing a larger-scale matrix using Arduino in the future.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository_url>

2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:
cd <folder_name>

3. Compile the program using `make`:

Copy code

4. Run the executable `./main`:

## Features
- SFML-based graphical interface for LED matrix simulation.
- 10 x 10 LED matrix for pattern creation and testing.
